AntiScraper blocks scrapers that steal content from your blogs. It has an internal blacklist provided by a community
of writers and bloggers. When a blog scraper is detected, it is blocked from stealing content. Free for 30 days, and only$10 per year.

== Description ==

AntiScraper is a web service you connect to your blog to block web scrapers. Web scrapers are used to
grab your blog posts and post them on an "autopilot" blog. Stealing content harms your Google rank, and
it costs you ad money and viewers. 

AntiScraper uses a community-based blacklist of known scrapers to block the "bot" from taking your content.
The web service is called, and if the website is a part of the blacklist, the scraper is blocked. This
does not protect from someone manually copying and pasting your content to their blog, but it stops the
bots, making it more difficult for people to steal your blog posts.

Please support the effort to report scrapers and send a report at http://antiscraper.com.
